        <p>The concatenated dataset is a large version, which combines the datasets of all 28 EU member state countries. The data is collected from national and regional portals of the member states where the beneficiary lists are published. We have collected 115 datasets, 21 datasets are missing. This means that for most countries, we have identified all data for all Structural Funds. However for Ireland, UK, Spain, and Austria we still have major gaps. </p>
        <p>The original files are described <a href="https://github.com/os-data/eu-structural-funds/blob/master/documentation/subsidyreport%20-%20dataset%20descriptions.pdf">here</a>  For creating the joined datasets out of these files, we mapping every single datasets to common denominator variables that can be compared between the countries. You can find a list of all variables used below.  More information on the methods can be found in the Methodology section. </p>
